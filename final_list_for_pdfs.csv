A systematic review of the enduring effects on managers from executive coaching,International Coaching Psychology Review,,,10.53841/bpsicpr.2021.16.2.22,,"This systematic review explores the enduring, individual effects on managers following executive coaching, which is a widely used, expensive intervention. To date, short-term effects appear largely positive, although the medium and long-term individual effects are largely under-investigated. The data for the review comprise primary studies published in peer-reviewed journals reporting individual outcomes on managers from executive coaching where data were collected at least one month after the end of the coaching. Evidence of enduring outcomes from the 16 retained studies was integrated using narrative synthesis. Research insights from the studies were integrated using techniques of meta-synthesis. The synthesis of evidence suggests that effects in the cognitive, behavioural and affective domains persist in the months following the coaching and that some effects may emerge only after the intervention has ended. The insights from the retained studies suggest that enduring outcomes involve two key sub-processes occurring within the overall coaching process: ‘psychological resourcing’ and ‘leader identity development’. Overall, the systematic review highlights the paucity of research on how the effects of executive coaching unfold over time and the absence of a theoretical framework to guide research in this area. Specific knowledge gaps are identified and future research strategies are proposed.",2021,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,22-50,,2,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data were gathered using semistructured interviews with nine women (n = 9) who made significant inroads in their respective professions. Theme analyses were applied to analyse the data.Main findings: The findings revealed six factors that hinder the career advancement of women to senior leadership positions: societal perceptions and stereotypes, a lack of mentorship, masculine corporate cultures, leadership identity distortions, inadequate training and development and poor work-life balance.Practical/managerial implications: Organisations are encouraged to create more feminine workplace cultures that allow women to realise their full potential and establish their identity as senior leaders. Mentoring, networking, and professional development opportunities can all assist women in advancing their careers. Senior female leaders play an essential role in fostering workplace cultures that promote equal opportunity and combat unfair discrimination on various grounds. They pave the way for younger, upcoming female talent to move into senior management positions more quickly.Contribution/value-add: This study fills important gaps in the global understanding of the factors limiting women’s career advancement to senior leadership positions.

A multi-case approach was used. Sampling was convenient and opportunistic and comprised of 15 charted accountants who attended six 90-min coaching sessions over 12 weeks. Data gathering comprised field notes and coachee essays during and after coaching. Hermeneutic phenomenology was used as the interpretive stance.Results: Anxiety, task, role, boundaries, authorisation and identity manifested as themes. Coachees explored how their leadership identity was informed by their anxiety and defence mechanisms, how they took up their leadership role, authorised themselves and their colleagues, and managed their boundaries effectively. Compared to the general guidelines for leadership coaching effectiveness and the general indicators for effective leadership, systems psychodynamic leadership coaching seems to add value to leadership effectiveness.Conclusion: Professionals in this financial services organisation experienced systems psychodynamic leadership coaching as demanding, challenging and yet fulfilling towards the exploration of their leadership identity. It seems that systems psychodynamics, as coaching stance, created a safe and good-enough container for these financial professionals to explore their own unconscious leadership behaviour and to gain a significant level of understanding and awareness of their own anxiety and defensive behaviours in their interaction with followers.",2018,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,,,1,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The field of engineering has made only slow and modest progress at increasing the participation of Indigenous people; an identity-conscious focus on leadership in engineering may help connect the practice of engineering with Indigenous students’ motivations and values. Methods: This study utilized a grounded theory qualitative approach to understand how Indigenous engineering students at a U.S.-based university experience engineering leadership. We explored the experiences of four Indigenous engineering students through one interview and one focus group. Results: Students pointed out how Indigenous peoples had long engaged in engineering work before contact with European settlers, and they saw an opportunity for leadership in applying their engineering knowledge in ways that uplifted their home communities. Conclusion: In addition to ways that engineering programs can better support Indigenous students who aspire to become practicing engineers, our study pointed to new directions engineering programs could take to frame engineering work as providing a toolkit to improve one’s community to leverage a wider set of motivations for entering engineering among many different communities underrepresented in engineering, including Indigenous students.",2021,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,675,,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drawing on in-depth qualitative interviews with nine female academics in Chinese universities and informed by discursive approaches to identity and constructionist views, we analyze how women construct multiple identities, the interplay of identities, and the influence of broader societal Discourses of gender and leadership. The findings highlight the interplay between competing multiple identities, and illustrate how the women’s identities are shaped and constrained by dominant historical and cultural Discourses in Chinese society, which results in identity regulation (Alvesson and Billing 2009), notably identity positioning that is congruent with social norms and conventions. A key finding is that the female academics reject the leader identity.

We conducted qualitative and inductive research with Brazilian executives in 66 organizations, focusing on their experiences as leaders. In our resulting model, we theorized that leaders in positions of Marginal Leadership demonstrate little role clarity, resources, and confidence for the exercise of their activities, suffering threats to their identities, which are not observed in executives occupying positions in more traditional functions such as Finance, Production, and Marketing. Furthermore, we identified that Brazilian executives responsible for Diversity and Inclusion build three types of Relational Leadership in interaction with individuals in historically disadvantaged positions, and alongside executives in traditional positions. First, “Business Partner,” focusing on performance—boundary segmentation. Second, “Injustice Repairer,” focusing on inclusion—boundary segmentation. Third, “Paradox Manager,” focusing on performance and inclusion—boundary integration. Finally, we found that threats to their identities vary according to the type of Marginal Leadership constructed. While “Business Partners” and “Injustice Repairers” tend to be seen as false representatives or politically inept, the “Paradox Manager” tends to be labeled as a “Fence Sitter.” This study advances the understanding of role identities in positions with ambiguous expectations, integrating Identity Theory and Boundary Theory to explore how diversity leaders integrate their identities in the light of conflicting demands.",2024,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,,,,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It contributes insights into how a decolonizing coaching space enables and guides a coachee to reflect and rethink the navigation of the realities of her decolonial identity. The decolonial identity encapsulates the authentic self and the neoliberal identity is the plastic self in a neoliberal university context. Universities' pervasive and normalized neoliberal discourse has become a “paradigm”—the overarching worldview through which universities' visions, missions, strategic objectives, and values are constructed. For academics to thrive in their performance and “walk on water” in achieving performance targets, they ought to embrace being academic capitalists, which shapes idealized neoliberal identities—conforming identities, complicit in undermining social, economic, and epistemic justice. Qualitative research methods were utilized to conduct a reflexive study, and data collected from the reflections and reflexive dialogues in leadership development coaching sessions and journals were thematically analyzed. The study reveals that the coach and coachee's shared decolonial identity offered counter-narratives that unmask the dominant great “white” man leadership in organizations. It also illuminates insights into the significance of black feminist pedagogy in the coaching process to honor the coachee's decolonial identity and rich cultural experiences. It enabled her to explore them critically and derive meanings from developing decolonizing, critically conscious leadership strategies for emerging transformation challenges. Meaningful dialogue dimensions emerged, which served as lenses that steered a decolonial approach in supporting the coachee to reflect and rethink the leadership performance vision, strategic objectives, action plans, implementation, and monitoring.",2024,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,,,,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has brought about significant changes in ways of working and associated ways of being that have become more fragmented and virtual. Disruptive change continues to unfold on many levels of society, from the organizational to the individual level, with multiple and often unintended consequences. This article outlines how the body of work of Dynamic Presencing in a group coaching context facilitates responsive forms of personal development as well as a deeper transformation of one’s leadership identity in the face of such change, which in turn serves as an approach that can be useful in navigating VUCA conditions that are becoming increasingly prevalent. The transformative process of Dynamic Presencing develops core inner leadership capabilities with a noted increase in the quality of internal and interpersonal forms of self-,presence-, and presencing-awareness.

A structural equation model and Mplus software were used to examine the direct relationship between employee voice and abusive supervision, as well as the mediating effect of leader identity threat and the moderating effect of supervisor traditionality.ResultsOur results showed that employee voice was positively related to leader identity threat and had an indirect effect on abusive supervision via leader identity threat. In addition, we found that supervisor traditionality moderated the relationship between employee voice and leader identity threat.

This rate of change was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which left organizations and their leadership to deal with myriad of challenges. These changes also impacted leaders’ identities in their work and their roles in their organizations. We examine how leaders responded to the various workplace challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and what this meant for their work identities as leaders. To do this, we made use of role identity theory, social identity theory, and leader identity. A qualitative study was conducted with a group of eight senior leaders from various South African and global organizations who had between five and 10 years’ work experience, and some had even more. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, conducted virtually and in person. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. The main finding that emerged from the research was that leaders employed virtual leadership to ensure that customers’ expectations were met, and to manage team-and organizational performance. These leaders achieved this by fostering a digital culture and building effective teams. They achieved their leadership goals by ensuring social identity continuity amongst their teams. This required them taking on extra roles, such as strategist, technology expert, entrepreneur, coach, mentor, and member of the team.

Previous research has shown that language teachers, typically pressured by heavy workloads, may face emotional challenges from multiplied sources, especially in the context of educational changes such as curriculum reform and the COVID-19 emergency. Current literature on teachers’ emotions largely centers around ordinary language teachers, with teacher leaders whose agentic actions often exert greater influence on the effectiveness of educational changes rarely examined. Situated in a top-tier research university that has been promoting an English for Academic Purposes reform to enhance its science students’ multilingual competence in academic contexts, this longitudinal case study tracked the emotional trajectory of an English teacher, Lea, for 5 years. Adopting an ecological perspective, our study confirms that language teachers’ emotions vary across the reform ecosystems and extends the current inquiry by conceptualizing the intricately interrelated teacher emotion, agency, power, and identity as dynamic constructs. This study also reveals how the reform-inflected emotional changes were associated with Lea’s EAP teacher and teacher leader identity construction, with both identities reinforcing each other, which to some extent reconciled Lea’s emotional tensions.

However, large-scale empirical investigations in this area are rare, and there is even less attention to the current situation of rural teacher curriculum leadership. Based on the survey of 2,966 rural teachers in 20 provinces of China, this paper presented the status quo of rural teacher curriculum leadership and examined influencing factors through multiple linear regression analysis. It was found that curriculum leadership of rural teachers was at a low level with backward leadership views, lack of practical ability, and low sense of identity. Regression analysis demonstrated that individual field factors had a significant impact on teachers’ curriculum leadership. Specifically, the higher the teachers’ leadership willingness, trust in others, and self-efficacy, the higher the curriculum leadership. The school field was also an important influential aspect. In particular, the formation of a common vision and teacher community by the school and the appropriate empowerment of the principal had a significant positive impact on the curriculum leadership of rural teachers.

Considering that moral leadership can promote innovation behavior of individuals through psychological factors, this study defines the types of innovation behavior, and from the perspective of psychological safety and identifying with leaders, discusses the impact of moral leadership on individuals’ innovation behavior by using hierarchical multivariate regression analysis, which provides inspiration for schools to strengthen the innovation behavior of physical education teachers. In this study, 327 questionnaires were distributed to PE teachers in Chinese provinces and 287 valid questionnaires were collected. The analysis of the collected data was performed with the help of the SPSSAU data analysis platform. The following conclusions were drawn: First, moral leadership has a significant positive impact on the psychological safety and internal and external innovation of physical education teachers. Secondly, moral leadership influences employees’ innovation behavior through psychological safety, and plays a part of intermediary role between moral leadership and internal and external innovation behavior; Third, by comparing the two impact mechanisms of innovation behavior, we found that moral leadership encourages employees to produce more external innovation behavior through psychological safety; Finally, strong leadership identity plays a positive role in regulating the relationship between moral leadership and innovation behavior.",2022,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,,,,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to other approaches and programs which focus on leaders’ leader identity (their ‘I-ness’), the 5R leadership development program supports the development of leaders’ social identity by raising awareness of the importance of social identity (‘we-ness’) for leadership and taking leaders through structured activities that help them build engaged and inclusive teams.

The context is derived from a study of Māori leadership and decision-making. The methodology is qualitative and underpinned by Kaupapa Māori research. Methods include pūrākau – Māori epistemology in the form of storytelling. Data is sourced from digital archives in the form of documentaries capturing a rich array of Māori leadership in ritual, ceremonies and interviews with leaders in multiple settings. The process of wānanga (collaborative interactive learning) was required for translation of material from Te Reo Māori into English. As a central feature of a Māori collective memory paradigm, words act as a key, unlocking insight and deeper levels of understanding inherent in Māori epistemology, mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge) and ontology. We employ whakapapa, a framework for understanding cultural identity and layering of relationships to inform analysis by offering a new concept to the literature; pūmahara, a generative collective memory code. This highlights continuity in the enactment of Māori leadership identities and values which signal social affiliation, self-affirmation and belonging.

Implications for leadership research,Leadership,,,10.1177/1742715019856159,,"Interviews are a way, if not the key way, in which knowledge of leadership and leader identity is sought. Yet, the interviews as a site of the construction of this knowledge are often “black-boxed” and few scholars consider how the “what” of leadership and leader identity are constructed as in situ social practice. Taking a discursive approach to leadership, and using membership categorization analysis as a methodological tool, this paper considers the identity work that participants do when constructing (Japanese) leadership and leader identity in a research interview. Findings indicate that leader identity is fragmented and contradictory and that identity work is skewed to producing a morally acceptable leader identity that has little to do with revealing underlying truths of leadership as often assumed. On the basis of these findings, we call for the discursive turn in leadership research to go beyond considering leadership-in-action to also consider the way in which both meanings of leadership and leader identities are discursively constructed as in situ social practice, notably in research interviews. Second, we call for more careful consideration and analysis of research interview as a site for building knowledge of leadership and leader identities, which, close analysis reveals to be fluid, changeable, and even contradictory. Third, we argue that researchers should also analyze what the particular constructions of leadership and leader identities “do.” This aligns with calls for more critical approaches to leadership studies that challenge hegemonic views of leadership and seek to make visible the power dynamics of presenting leadership and leader identity in one way rather than another.",2019,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,180-199,,2,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The organization development project reformed the supervisory work to include more tasks related to production activities, which facilitated a new interpretation of the supervisors as leaders. We analyse how the inclusion of supervisors in the daily production practices induced an identity change where the supervisors came to be identified as leaders in production. We argue that contextual changes at the level of organizing practices can influence leadership and leader emergence.",2017,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,103-122,,1,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little, if any, research considers leaders’ life stories as a topic for research and investigates the in situ, context sensitive, interactional accomplishment of such stories. Using a video-recorded extract of an alumni talk to MBA students at an American business school, taking a social constructionist approach to identity, and using positioning theory as a methodology, the purpose of this paper is to reveal the “nitty gritty” of talking oneself into being as a “leader” through the in situ telling of a life story as a “leader’s” life story.

We note a substantial number of studies seeking to develop theories of political and public leadership, particularly in more collaborative directions, but no studies that seek to explore how such demands are experienced by the political leaders who occupy leadership roles. We adopt a poststructuralist approach to identity as a means of empirically exploring how government ministers construct their identities. Drawing on 51 interviews with senior politicians, we propose a model of flexible political leadership identity, which argues that just as public agencies in these austere times are asked to do more with less, so political leaders seem to need to be more but with less perceived discretionary power. We propose four identities that answer quite different leadership demands: ‘the consultor’, ‘the traveller,’ ‘the adjudicator’ and ‘the master.’ These are semi-occupied identities, partial fulfilments of contemporary but contradictory leadership discourses.

Our research draws on the extensive theorising on social identity, but we take a critical perspective, arguing that public discourses of Aboriginality mean that leadership identities in Indigenous communities have a complex, sometimes contested status. We begin the article showing the way in which Aboriginality as an identity is constructed in the public domain. We then explore three categories of identity practice enacted by our sample of arts leaders: contesting essentialisation, containing trauma and creating belonging. The discussion argues that these practices of interrogating and re-shaping stereotypic cultural identities often constitute acts of leadership.

Taking a discursive approach to leadership in which leaders emerge as those who have most influence in communicatively constructing the organisation, and using transcripts of naturally occurring decision-making talk, the purpose of this paper is to make visible the seen but unnoticed discursive resources by which leader identity emerges in talk. More specifically, using actor network theory as a methodology, this paper focusses on how the director of an organisation ventriloquises (i.e. makes another actor speak through the production of a given utterance) other entities to do leadership. Findings indicate that leadership is achieved by making relevant to the interaction hybrid presences of actants that allow certain organisational players to influence the communicative construction of the organisation and so manage the meaning of organisational reality. In this way, social actors talk into being a ‘leader identity’, which is not necessarily a purely human physical presence, but can also be a hybrid presence of human and nonhuman actants, which are dislocated across time and space. The hybrid production of presence(s) also allows leaders to enact authority as a way of influencing others to accept their version of organisational reality.",2015,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,301-319,,3,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This generates tensions that undermine the construction of a more stable and coherent leader identity. The study finds that in order to resolve these tensions, the managers develop metaphorical selves—Mother Teresa, messiah and coach—as a way of trying to accommodate conflicting identity claims while remaining true to the idea of themselves as authentic leaders exercising good leadership.

To maintain their leadership identity in leader–member relationships, leaders have to elicit emotions that are contingent on the identity of the member. As such, members play a key role in defining leadership. We apply the symbolic interactionist approach of affect control theory and its operationalization in computer simulations to investigate the emotion management of leaders. To do so, we determine which emotions are most normative for leaders to show during their interactions with members that assume identities as passive followers versus active colleagues. The results reveal that the identity of a passive follower elicits emotions that are relatively negative (e.g. defiant, mad, shocked, alarmed, anxious) from leaders, whereas the active colleague identity generates comparatively positive emotions (e.g. pleased, delighted, glad, amused, thankful, relaxed, serene).",2014,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,412-436,,4,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response, this article proposes a complementary alternative focus for research and practice in the leadership area. It advances the use of the symbolic and relational aspects of leadership as highlighted in the three subgenres of dramatism namely: Kenneth Burke’s dramatism (life is drama ), Erving Goffman’s dramaturgy (life is like drama ) and Victor Turner’s social drama (life and drama are interdependent ). There-after the article explores the key distinctions between the three sub-genres so as to identify their analytical as well as explanatory focus.

To develop a more thorough and nuanced appreciation of the implications of narcissism for leaders' identity work, the article articulates a gendered perspective on narcissism that accounts for forms of leadership that are self-focused but not necessarily traditionally masculine. Four types of leadership narcissism are identified and illustrated: the bully, the star performer, the servant, and the victim. While each of these forms is narcissistic in that identity is associated with the defence of a grandiose self-image (ego ideal) through the admiration of others and the love of the self, they achieve this in markedly different, and gendered, ways.

The current paper examines these questions across three epochs of the lifespan (i.e., adolescence, early adulthood, and mid-adulthood) with a quasilongitudinal design. Drawing from a prospective database of 107 participants spanning over 26 years, we test within and between system effects of the leader experience processing system (i.e., leadership roles at ages 17, 29, and 38) and the leader self-view system (i.e., general self-concept at age 12, leader self-efficacy at age 17, and leader identity at ages 29 and 38). Structural equation modeling results support consistency in both systems, with more support for consistency in the leader self-view system. In addition, both systems mediate the other over time, suggesting a dynamic interplay whereby leaders integrate and build on leadership experiences in a process we call spontaneous leader development. Contrary to theory, we only found evidence for bi-directional relationships between systems in adolescence and early adulthood; in mid-adulthood at age 38, leader identity informed leadership roles but not vice versa.

Underlying this identity work is the belief that the social identity of being a leader is positive—something that leaders both privately endorse and want publicly conferred by others. However, this process is complex for women leaders who are simultaneously navigating the identity work of being women in male-dominated leadership positions. We conducted a qualitative investigation of women in senior leadership roles to examine how they construct a leader identity by managing private and public endorsements of both a leader and a female identity. Our results indicate that women leaders engage in leader and gender identity work whereby they actively manage how they privately self-endorse and publicly allow others to endorse their leader and female identities using identity hybridization. In so doing, they mix and recombine elements of both their leader and gender identities to construct a coherent female leader identity. Doing so allows them to benefit from the complementarity of these identities, while mitigating the risks associated with publicly and privately endorsing these two identities in tandem. This approach to identity hybridization allows women leaders to maintain a sense of agency, effectiveness, and authenticity in the face of identity tensions.",2023,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,59-75,,1,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such complexities, related to the implied superiority of maleness, call for a review of research related to the leadership experiences of evangelical women, with implications for professional development programs.

Leader categorization theory, for instance, suggests that subordinates use their cognitive representation of an ideal leader (ideal leader prototype) as an implicit “benchmark” to determine their openness towards the target’s leadership, i.e., influence. With the present study, we extend this rationale by hypothesizing that such benchmarking processes are subject to follower individual differences. In particular, we argue that the process of leader categorization plays a bigger role for subordinates who perceive themselves as ideal (potential) leaders. Moreover, this two-way moderation is proposed to be further qualified by subordinates’ disposition to engage in social comparison orientation. Results of two field samples with employees ( N = 140; N = 287) confirm our hypotheses. In integrating the leader categorization perspective with an individual difference perspective, we not only expand the scope of follower-centric theorizing on social influence, but also support its validity.",2011,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,605-622,,5,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using narrative analysis and case study research, our findings suggest that daughters construct and negotiate their gender and leadership identities in their interactions with others by opposing, expanding and making use of the gendered scripts available to them.

We identify multiple leadership archetypes embedded in individuals’ identity narratives, representing their differing senses of themselves as leaders and their alignment with the organizational narrative of collective leadership. These archetypes are mutually constitutive, representing centripetal and centrifugal tendencies in relation to the organizational narrative of collective leadership. We show how individuals committed to collective leadership nevertheless construct an individual leader (the Avatar identity archetype) to embody the collective on their behalf, and this enables them to grant leadership to the collective in the abstract. We emphasize the persistent sacralization of leadership in individual and organizational narratives, even in avowedly collectivist contexts, and the value of narrative-based perspectives in highlighting practitioners’ ability to navigate and accommodate the messy coexistence of collective and individual leadership.

We find that the belief of making a decisive difference to others’ development by caring for them can be a deceptive fantasy that incites over-dependence among subordinates, particularly for ambitious managers who experience pressing situations and little power.

We tested our theoretical expectations in two field experiments. In the first study, as expected, we find that leaders reported higher activated leader identity and more goal progress on intervention (vs. control) days. In turn, activated leader identity and goal progress enhanced leader well-being measured in the evening at home. Surprisingly, and contrary to expectations, the well-being enhancing effects of positive leader self-reflection were weaker for leaders who were higher (vs. lower) in identity fusion with their followers.

The challenge for new leaders is to shift their role identity from innovative individual contributor to leader and for the organization to provide the support and reward structures to develop leaders of innovation. Degrees of role identity shift range from incremental shift (remaining an individual contributor through technical updating and employee development) through substantial shift (adding elements of leadership to one’s role and identity) to radical shift (complete transformation into becoming a leader in behavior and identity). As part of this approach, we apply the idea of creative destruction to leader development and, consistent with identity literature, argue that the idea of identity destruction is sometimes a legitimate part of leader development. In a process model, we predict the degree of leader role identity shift depends on, and is influenced by, organizational policies and resources. Also, we illustrate how some efforts by organizations to enhance technical innovation and individual development may have the effect of inhibiting leader identity development.",2015,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,1426-1452,,4,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conceptualized model proposes that the lack of in-depth conversations via virtual communication platforms leads to the development of weak emotional interactions between virtual expatriates and HCNs. However, weakened emotional interactions might result in positive or negative impact on expatriates’ identity based on personality-based differences. In this regard, expatriates with collective self-esteem are likely to experience social identity threats because of weakened social ties with HCNs. Contrary to the above group, expatriates having personal self-esteem would view weak socialization as an opportunity and experience an improvement in their leader identity, thus experience a positive social identity change over time.

Recent trends have changed the landscape on which business leaders pursue interests of various stakeholders. To be successful in the 21st century, business leaders at all levels must possess three important capacities— authenticity, integrity, and creativity—and enact them at work, in their families, in their communities, and in their personal growth. Building these capacities requires innovative means for educating and developing leaders.

Integrating theory on best possible selves with control theory, we suggest that activating a best possible leader self can have beneficial effects for the way that any employee feels and behaves at work. Specifically, we propose that employees who reflect on their best possible leader self will enact more leader‐congruent behaviors and subsequently perceive themselves as more leaderlike due to the positive affect generated by such reflection. We found support for our theoretical expectations in an experimental experience sampling study that included both current and aspiring leaders. On days when employees reflected on their best possible leader self, they engaged in more helping and visioning via positive affect. Furthermore, employees perceived themselves as more leaderlike after performing these leader‐congruent behaviors, as captured by higher enacted leader identity and clout.

Results, based on data from 386 followers matched with 268 leaders, linked both a Dark Triad identity and a Dark Triad reputation to less perceived social worth and job satisfaction among leaders. Additional results found leader charisma surpassed a Dark Triad identity and reputation as an explanatory factor, a finding we attribute to the salience and observability of charisma to followers. Lastly, our results also indicate a leader identity × charisma interaction. The pattern of moderation suggests followers respond to leader charisma in ways that encourage a leader and thereby buffer the otherwise inimical consequences of a Dark Triad identity.

Further, it simultaneously incorporates the role of various factors to develop a comprehensive understanding of positive as well as negative change experiences of female executives. Based on thorough review and integration of the relevant literature from the domains of organizational behaviour, gender management, and psychology, key themes have been extracted and a conceptual model has been proposed. It is suggested that female executives are likely to face epistemological shock after becoming a part of male‐dominated TMTs; however, proactive interactions and development of their cultural toolkit is expected to polish leadership capabilities and improve leader identity in them. Conversely, challenges in developing their cultural toolkit may lead to experiences of emotional exhaustion and the eventual psychological detachment of female executives from their teams and work environment. Unlike the focus of existing literature on general social and cultural challenges faced by female workers, this research offers a unique theoretical direction regarding the essence of extensive psychological changes and their long‐term prospects for females in male‐dominated TMTs.

Additionally, COVID‐19 has deeply affected organizational climate and workplace behaviour. Therefore, drawing on the affective events theory, we examined the COVID‐19 pandemic as a context shaping the effects of supervisor‐directed deviance on retaliation against subordinates in the United States. We conducted two quasi‐experiments with pre‐ and post‐COVID‐19 (Study 1, n = 97) and Wave 1–Wave 3 pandemic study designs (Study 2, n = 94), respectively, and found that supervisor‐directed deviance triggered felt leader identity threat, consequently leading to retaliation against subordinates; this indirect effect strengthened as the pandemic progressed. We replicated these findings using a field study during the third wave of the pandemic (Study 3, n = 190), which established external validity by expanding the types of deviant and retaliatory behaviours examined.

The purpose of this paper is to answer the question of how people construct and develop their leader identity. The authors intend to shed light on the critical facets of identity changes that occur as individuals grapple with existing understanding of the self and of leadership, transform them, and absorb new personalized notions of leadership into their identity, resulting in a higher level of confidence acting in the leadership domain.

Participants in the mentor group were volunteer mentors from a doctoral mentoring program that was implemented at a large Canadian university.FindingsParticipants in the mentor group experienced a more positive change in leader identity and leader self-efficacy, compared to the participants in the nonmentor group. Further analysis of the participants in the mentor group suggests that the extent to which mentors provide career and psychosocial support explains the growth rate in the development outcomes.Practical implicationsBy documenting benefits of mentoring for mentors, program administrators may be able to recruit mentors who are more engaged in the process. In addition, they can encourage their members to volunteer as mentors to gain leader development outcomes.Originality/valueThis longitudinal study connects the areas of mentoring and leadership development.

The topic is of significant importance as leadership identity tends to form early in life, and its long-term implications contribute to leadership formation. The objective of this study was to gain insights into how leadership is constructed in young adults and how it is manifested in their preferred leadership identity.Design/methodology/approachThis research was approached from a constructivist perspective, utilizing discourse analysis. The authors conducted a study involving 24 written essays by young individuals with a business background, in which they shared their early leadership experiences. Drawing upon a modified life story interview structure, the authors meticulously analyzed the content.FindingsThe authors identified eight discourses clustered into two groups according to the types of leadership orientation: toward oneself and toward others. The discourses in the toward oneself group consist of leadership as taking responsibility, leadership as courage, manifesting personal strengths and as a role/status. The toward others group includes discourses approaching leadership as balancing directivity, coordinating and organizing work, personalized approach and as performance management.Research limitations/implicationsThe major methodological limitations stem from the qualitative design per se. The findings based on qualitative data have limits in generalizing.Practical implicationsThe authors' findings have practical implications for educators. The authors propose the utilization of critical self-reflection on early leadership experiences and self-narration as effective tools in nurturing and developing young leaders.Social implicationsThis paper underscores the importance of educating young leaders, as they can create a positive impact on their subordinates and society as a whole. By providing them with leadership skills, the authors initiate a chain reaction of influence that extends through different levels of leadership, leading to significant social change.Originality/valueThe authors' originality and contribution to the literature on leadership development lies in showcasing the diversity of perspectives on leadership among participants sharing a similar background and developmental stage.

Design/methodology/approach The required data were collected through semistructured interviews with 30 senior-level female leaders in the corporate sector of Pakistan and analyzed using NVivo. Findings Successful professional women are often facilitated by various social and organizational factors that boost their confidence and ability to view themselves positively as leaders, reducing woman-leader identity conflict. The main facilitators observed were egalitarian values practiced at home, male sponsorship in organizations and individual leadership experiences. Furthermore, the age and socio-economic status of women have also emerged as important factors contributing to the success of women leaders in Pakistani society, which is characterized by gender inequality and high power distance.

Alongside this theorisation, gender and leadership remain of considerable interest, particularly given the under-representation of women in leadership positions. Methodological approaches to understanding leadership have begun to embrace innovative methods, such as historical analyses. This paper aims to understand how high profile women leaders construct a gendered leadership identity, with particular reference to authentic leadership. Design/methodology/approach Thematic analysis of autobiographies, a form of identity work, of four women leaders from business and politics: Sheryl Sandberg, Karren Brady, Hillary Clinton and Julia Gillard. Findings Analyses reveal that these women construct gender and leadership along familiar normative lines; for example, the emphasis on personal and familial values. However, their stories differ in that the normative extends to include close examination of the body and a sense of responsibility to other women. Overall, media representations of these “authentic” leaders conform to social constructions of gender. Thus, in the case of authentic leadership, a theory presented as gender neutral, the authenticity of leadership has to some extent been crafted by the media rather than the leader.

The perspective presented is based on premises from the complexity sciences.Design/methodology/approachThe article is based on a conceptual discussion.FindingsLeadership is better understood as identity construction. This is because leadership emerges in the interaction between people as the act of recognising and being recognised. Leaders' images of themselves are therefore social constructions and the development of a leadership self (and thereby leadership) is coupled to the interaction between leaders and followers.Research limitations/implicationsThe research is limited to a conceptual discussion. The findings need to be further explored and challenged by other methods. The discussion is focused on organisational leadership.Practical implicationsLeaders do not always have the control that mainstream leadership theory suggests. The act of leadership is therefore better understood as identity construction. In the article the authors suggest a conceptual framework for reflecting on leadership identity because self‐images influence people's acts as leaders. The concept of leadership is hence the ability to mobilise the discipline necessary to develop one's self by reflecting on identity in different contexts and coupling this to the acts of leadership.Originality/valueThe principal contribution is a conceptual discussion on the concept of leadership.

Moreover, it spawned research interest in understanding the conditions that may prompt some leaders to pursue their own interests at the expense of their group, whereas others do not. This study explored whether the interplay between leader self-construal and leader power may explain this phenomenon. Across one laboratory experiment and one organizational survey, we showed that leader power interacted with leader self-construal in predicting leader self-serving behavior. Overall, our studies suggest that leader self-construal substantially shapes leader internal states and goals, and that the effects hereof on self-interested behavior are strengthened under conditions of high power.",2012,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,40-48,,1,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon entry into college and toward the end of their sophomore year we measured (1) participants’ quantity and quality of contact with successful ingroup members (female professors), (2) implicit and explicit leadership self-concept, (3) career goals, and (4) classroom behavior. Frequent contact with ingroup members predicted stronger implicit self-conceptions of leadership and more career ambitions, but only when contact experiences were of high quality rather than superficial. Quality and quantity of contact independently predicted assertive behavior. The findings suggest that changing implicit self-beliefs requires both high quality and frequent exposure to counterstereotypic individuals.",2010,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,203-211,,3,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Women primed with traditional gender roles (e.g., a male surgeon and a female nurse) showed increased automatic gender stereotypes relative to controls; this effect mediated their reduced interest in masculine occupations. By contrast, exposure to nontraditional roles (e.g., a female surgeon and a male nurse) decreased women’s leadership self-concept and lowered their interest in masculine occupations, suggesting that female vanguards (i.e., successful women in male-dominated careers) can provoke upward comparison threat, rather than inspire self-empowerment. Thus, priming either traditional or nontraditional gender roles can threaten progress toward gender equality, albeit through different mechanisms (stereotypes or self-concept, respectively).",2010,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,192-202,,3,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article explores a particular type of these other leadership constellations, namely co-leadership where members share several leadership responsibilities.Drawing on more than twenty hours of authentic discourse data recorded in two workplaces in Hong Kong, we employ the analytical concepts of face and identity to identify and describe some of the complex processes through which co-leadership is enacted. Our particular focus is situations in which members of the co-leadership team disagree with each other.Our findings indicate that co-leadership is a dynamic process in which both members position themselves and each other as leader and co-leader at different moments throughout an interaction.

Utilising characteristics of legitimisation, institutionalisation and self-determination theories the paper observes how women manage upward mobility. Subsequently, it was important to investigate the mid-level cohorts, as there lies the critical question triggering the anomaly. Focusing on the public sector with an interest in gendered organisations, the study examines law enforcement. Conversely, the aim of this paper is to focus on why there is a continued dearth in the number of policewomen at top level positions in USA and Australia. A qualitative study with a phenomenological approach is applied. Semi-structured interviews are conducted with 40 policewomen in mid-management positions in American and Australian law enforcement. It further aims to explore the linkages of the ongoing paucity of gendered leadership in organisations, questioning how these will influence women's ability to advance to higher-level positions.",2019,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,1078-1099,,5,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The researchers utilized qualitative analysis of triangulated, predominantly qualitative data. The analysis drew on core elements of grounded theory. It was found that both macro- and micro-dimensions of culture had an impact on Australian Muslim understandings of leadership and subsequently had an impact on leading. The analysis also uncovered intra- and inter-cultural complexity within Muslim organizations. The concept of an ‘iron cage’ of micro-cultures emerged to integrate these findings. An abstract storyline is posed wherein a new leadership identity will facilitate empowerment and uncertainty resolution about the stress of cultural complexity, resulting in more effective leadership.",2019,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,888-908,,4,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper explores links between identity formation, and the subsequent development of shared leadership. It explores how a programme to develop shared leadership changed a public science organisation, from one dependent on hierarchical leadership, to one that also used shared leadership to better address the complex public context. Using Day and Harrison’s levels of leadership identity framework, this study first examines the processes of a development programme at individual, relational, and collective levels. Results reveal cascading growth in leadership identities through processes such as job crafting and contagion. Despite the resulting positive processes, inherent paradoxes of power, goals, and attitude underlying shared leadership development are also identified. Within these paradoxes, tensions between vertical hierarchy versus dispersed networks, task performance versus job crafting, fatigue versus revitalisation, and cynicism versus evangelism were found.",2018,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,564-581,,3,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By synthesizing 61 empirical studies based on the PRISMA methodology, eight central themes within MIW are identified: identity work of first-time managers, identity work of experienced managers, management development programs, external perceptions of identity, blurred identity, creation of preferred identity, identity work as a medium, and identity work of minorities. These themes are further integrated into aggregate dimensions—knowledge, awareness, motivation, and privilege—culminating in a conceptual model that elucidates the relationships between them. This study not only consolidates the extant literature but also provides a framework for understanding the key factors shaping managerial identity formation. By mapping the geographical and industrial contexts of MIW research, this review uncovers gaps in the literature and proposes directions for future inquiry, particularly regarding MIW’s implications for leadership development, organizational culture, and managerial legitimacy.",2024,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, we know little about the dynamics that characterize how leader identities change within individuals across short periods of time. The current work integrates theorizing on temporal dynamics in leadership research with event systems theory to describe and predict day-to-day shifts (i.e., unidirectional, sudden changes) and dynamic ebb and flow patterns (i.e., multidirectional, potentially nonlinear changes over multiple days) of individuals’ leader identities. Specifically, we argue that the experience of strong (i.e., novel, disruptive, extraordinary) daily events facilitates positive leader identity shifts, and that over time, the resulting identity ebb and flows are more pronounced in unfamiliar compared to familiar contexts. We collected experience sampling data from 69 young adults at a university in the UK across seven-day periods at three different time points during the academic year (1159 data points). Using dynamical systems modeling, we analyze the velocity (i.e., rate of change) and the acceleration (i.e., change in velocity) parameters of individuals’ leader identity dynamics. We find that (a) on a daily level, strong events prompt positive shifts in leader identity, and that (b) over time, chains of stronger and weaker events provoke similar patterns of leader identity ebb and flows. However, these relationships are not stronger in unfamiliar compared to familiar contexts. Our research informs the theoretical understanding of events and short-term leader identity dynamics. We discuss implications for theory and research, in particular how events can trigger leader identity formation.",2023,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,755-778,,3,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our theoretical model moves beyond existing research on leader identity construction− which largely treats individuals as blank slates as they construct who they will be as leaders in organizations− by highlighting how individuals learn to enact a leadership approach during socialization that fits within their personal zone of acceptable authenticity and the organization's zone of acceptable conformity. During socialization, individuals may experiment with discarding certain aspects of their existing leadership prototype and/or ignore certain aspects of the organization's leadership prototype, resulting in four primary types of leader–organization fit: Pretender, Believer, Maverick, or Rogue. Our model uncovers important outcomes associated with the varying levels of conformity and authenticity characteristic of these four types of leader–organization fit and highlights how one's fit might evolve over time as individuals engage with and learn from experiences as leaders.",2025,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, the year of publication, research method and design, country of participants, and theories central to author justification are analyzed. After sharing the results, contributions, and implications for the constructs of LID and meaning making are outlined, with attention given to theoretical and methodological areas for future research. Finally, an integrated constructivist model of LID is proposed that urges leadership scholars and practitioners to incorporate developmental, identity, learning, and meaning‐making theories into their discussions of LID.",2024,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,23-47,,3,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lynn; Egan, Chrys; Neilson, Brionne G.",The Capacious Model and Leader Identity: An Integrative Framework,Journal of Leadership Studies,,,10.1002/jls.21622,,"The Integrated Capacious Model of Leadership Identities Construction (ICM) is a framework for understanding leader identity that integrates four extant leader identity theories with the systems and influences in the Capacious Model of leader identity. The ICM's systems (Individual System, Microsystem, Mesosystem, Exosystem, Macrosystem, and Chronosystem) contextualize leader identity in time and space; its influences (Purpose/Calling, Self‐Identity, Social Identity, and Relationships) pinpoint select factors that affect the construction of leader identities; and its integrated theories (Narrative Identity, Identity Theory, Social Identity Theory, and Social Constructionism) address the leader identity construction process. The ICM speaks to calls for interdisciplinary, multi‐level frameworks that are situated within the stream of scholarly literature on leader identity, as the model presents leader identity as a construct located across space, time, and people, rather than the purview of a heroic leader or single instance of identity claiming. Connecting established identity theories, systems, and influences results in a descriptive, practical model of leader identity. Examples are provided of the practical utility of using the ICM as a diagnostic tool for constructing a leader identity, designing leader development programs, and identifying gaps in leader identity scholarship.",2019,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,19-Jun,,1,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ELUVJ4VU,journalArticle,2015,"Koskiniemi, Anne; Perttula, Juha; Syväjärvi, Antti",Existential–Experiential View of Self‐Sourced (In)Authentic Healthcare Identity,Journal of Leadership Studies,,,10.1002/jls.21360,,"AbstractIn the healthcare context, both nurses and doctors derive their professional identities from diverse backgrounds, thus resulting in two distinct professions. Becoming a leader and forming a leader identity that is separate from a strong professional identity is a difficult task. However, assuming a leader identity is considered an important aspect of actually being a leader, not just a professional with a leader position. The current article explores authenticity in generic healthcare leader identity formation by utilizing the concept of professional identity. Instead of committing to the humanistic ontological roots of the authentic leadership construct, the research analyzes the concepts of self and authenticity from an existential–experiential perspective. A conceptual framework of self‐sourced healthcare identity formation, including leader identity and professional identity, is presented. The framework shows how leader identity originates in the leader's experiencing self‐in‐situation, which is understood as the source of authenticity. The experiencing self, or the self as a subject, is differentiated from the experienced self, or the self as an object, by which professional identities are formed. The conceptualization provides a way of understanding and developing leadership in fields consisting of strong professional identities. The applications of the framework are also discussed.",2015,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,18-Jun,,2,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A two‐step process, this cross‐sectional study sought to investigate leadership development through the lens of the leadership identity development model as measured by the aptitude for commission grade. From a review of the military leadership curriculum at American service academies and military colleges, the initial phase of research established that leadership development occurred. The second phase used quantitative methods and a cross‐sectional design to investigate the effects of peer ranking, cumulative grade point average, leadership grades, and varsity athletic participation on leadership development throughout four years of undergraduate education. Findings indicated that company ranking by peers was significant regardless of gender or ethnicity. Mixed significant findings resulted for grade point average, leadership grades, and varsity athletic participation when based on gender and self‐identified minority status.",2010,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,18-29,,2,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

XCHEI26J,journalArticle,2014,"Muir, Douglas",Mentoring and Leader Identity Development: A Case Study,Human Resource Development Quarterly,,,10.1002/hrdq.21194,,"This study explored the influence of a formal mentoring program on the leader identity development of participants and how they developed their leader identity during their participation in a nondegree leadership development certification program. The central research question of this study was: How does a participant's identity as a leader develop over time and what influence does a formal mentoring program have on the formation of a leader identity. A qualitative case‐study approach with in‐depth semi‐structured interviews was used to gather the perspectives of participants and mentors. The study included 25 research participants including 11 mentor dyads. Three themes emerged from the data: (a) the mentor partnership–leader identity discovery, (b) leader identity development through critical learning moments, and (c) leader identity development through self‐knowledge. Findings of this research suggest that adult learning principles are instrumental components to the leader identity development process. The participants believed that their formal mentoring experience was pivotal to the discovery and development of their leader identity. Additionally, critical reflection on the critical learning moments was another of the key factors that led to their development of their identity as a leader. Suggestions for future research include: (a) the effects of adult learning approaches on leader identity development, and (b) the effect mentoring may have on the different stages of identity development.",2014,4/17/25 8:31,4/17/25 8:31,,349-379,,3,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How can one find one's responsible leadership identity in the midst of the changing and chaotic world? The building blocks can be found in psychologist Erik Erikson's way of resolving individual identity crises.The purpose of this paper is to adapt Erikson's model to individually, organizationally and societally responsible leadership and integrate them to achieve the best results. When working toward a responsible leader's identity, six areas of difficulty should be solved: (1) value basis, (2) self‐image vs external image, (3) time perspective, (4) role experimentation, (5) anticipation of achievement, and (6) leader‐follower relation.Responsibility and irresponsibility are contagious. Individuals, organizations and societies boost or repress responsible behavior: inspiring leaders pull others to higher ethical levels of behavior; greedy leaders push others back to lower levels of behavior. Be a responsible leader: care and dare.
